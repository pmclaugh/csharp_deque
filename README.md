# csharp_deque

A refactor/improvement of the queue implemented in pmclaugh/j-gravity-standalone/queue.c

Original behavior (singly-linked list used as a queue) is preserved, but also expanded into a double-ended queue (deque), allowing the same structure to be used as a stack.

Also includes unit tests.
